SELECT d.name AS Department, e.name AS Employee, e.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN (
    SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
) max_salaries
ON e.departmentId = max_salaries.departmentId
AND e.salary = max_salaries.max_salary
JOIN Department d
ON e.departmentId = d.id;
Explanation of Changes:
Correct Joining: The Department table is joined using d.id (the Department table’s id column) and e.departmentId (the Employee table’s departmentId column). This ensures the department name can be retrieved.
Aliasing: The table Department is aliased as d and used to reference the name column from the Department table.
